## Setup Telemetry For Your Application

If you are looking to integrate Telemetry with your application, you should follow these steps:

### 1. Define Events for your Application

1. The first step is to plan out the Events you are going to be capturing for your application. These events can be anything such as Clicking on a button, Sharing a link on your web app, Search, Total amount of time spent on an application etc.

2. Plan with your engineer on how to integrate these events in the organization applications. Provide the engineer with the excel sheet and the related information

3. Setup Posthog for your organization application. Posthog is where all these Events will be stored and analyzed in order to improve the application quality and the user experience

### 2. Embed the Code in Your Application
