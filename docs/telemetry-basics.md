## Telemetry Basics

Some basic concepts related to Telemetry:

- [Event Specifications for Telemetry events](http://docs.sunbird.org/latest/developer-docs/telemetry/specification/#events-specs)

When a user comes to a mobile app or web app, the interaction they do while they are on the app, can be tracked and captured to identify user behavior.

For example we can capture:
- Time spent on a particular section
- Buttons clicked, links clicked etc.

These events are captured in the background without explicitly informing the user.
